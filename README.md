# color-deficiency-kindly-vim-configurations
I have been suffering from both miderate protanomaly and mild deuteranomaly since I was born, which means it is impossible for me to distinguish many shades of red from blacks, or much tinted green/purple from yellows/blues.

I share my `Vim` configurations here and hope to help users working on Unix-like terminals (no GUI's) who are suffering from color deficiencies like me.

# Usage
To download and apply these configurations, run
```
git clone https://github.com/Jaden-Anderson/color-deficiency-kindly-vim-configurations.git
cd color-deficiency-kindly-vim-configurations/
. init.sh
```
One may check by `vim syncolor.vim` both before and after running `. init.sh` to see the difference,
and the directory can be deleted safely by
```
cd ..
rm -rf color-deficiency-kindly-vim-configurations/
```
after these configurations get applied successfully.
