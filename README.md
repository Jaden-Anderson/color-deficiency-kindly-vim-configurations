# color-deficiency-kindly-vim-configurations
I have been suffering from both miderate protanomaly and mild deuteranomaly since I was born, which means it is impossible for me to distinguish many shades of red from blacks, or much tinted green/purple from yellows/blues. So, I share my `Vim` configurations here and hope to help users working on `Unix`-like terminals (no GUI's) who are suffering from color deficiencies like me.
# Usage
Download these `*.vim` files and save them to the following path: `$HOME/.vim/after/syntax/`
One may need to create such directory first if not found: Use command as `mkdir -p $HOME/.vim/after/syntax`
